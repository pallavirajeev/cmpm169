				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I am trying to accomplish a creative piece that has the resemblance of the Northern Lights. In order to achieve this, I combined a background consistent of generated vector trees and twinkling stars, with colorful particles in a flowfield.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This experiment was based on Saad Anees 2019 piece of colorful artistic perlin flow. The piece was taken and then modified in order to reflect a generative art that resembles the Northern Lights. The background consists of twinkling generated stars and silhouettes of vector trees. The particles are colored in blue and green tones and are generated in a flowfield grid. The particles are to follow vectors in a grid and are impacted by specific conditions and influenced by perlin noise. This is what generates that smooth, flowing pattern. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked alone. The entire process definitely had some ups and downs. To start off, I wasn’t sure which piece from the examples to use as my starting point. I finally came across the Saad Anees and felt inspired. Immediately after seeing that piece I knew I wanted to take that piece and turn it into something of my own. The colorful particles reminded me of the Northern Lights. The Northern Lights are something I have been super interested in and would love to see one day. I am a big fan of the sky in general -from sunsets, to stargazing, and everything in between, so I knew this example was perfect and it had creative meaning to me as well. 
					The lows of this project was learning how to use p5.js. Since I am new to this platform, I had some trouble figuring out the beginning steps of how to even implement the project. However, the example I was using came with a tutorial so I just had to be patient and work at my own pace. I tried not to get frustrated when things didn’t go my way and when I had to spend more time experimenting and working with my code. Additionally, I really struggled with putting my finished code into my website, which was another frustrating low for me.
					The highs of this project was seeing the different components come together. I had the components of the particles, stars, and trees. Each time I added to my project and made the different components work together, I could really see my vision come to life. This made me happy and motivated to keep pursuing the project. 
					Overall, I am super happy with the end outcome of this project. I never thought I could code something like what I created, and it really does remind me of the Northern Lights which is touching to see. I am pleased with what I created, and I put in a lot of effort to get to a product I was happy with.
