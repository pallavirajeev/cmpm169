				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A blackout poetry piece using text and grammars to allow users to create their own poetry pieces from personally written lines. Users can click on the words they want to black out. This piece features a hidden aspect that forces users to embrace randomness and exhibit creativity. Users can press ‘space’ to reveal a hidden poem that will fill in the blacked out words and generate a new piece. To see the previously created blackout poem, users can press ‘B’, to bring back the blacked out form and then press ‘space’ again to go back to the newly generated hidden poem. Users can then continue to black out words of this new combination and create a new piece from the two layers of handwritten lines. To reset the poems and get a new combination, users can press ‘R’. </p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses p5.js to create an interactive blackout poetry experience that transforms creepy, horror-like themed texts into romantic poetry, all written by myself. The code maintains parallel arrays of original and hidden texts, randomly selecting a pair at startup and splitting them into word arrays. Words are rendered onto the canvas and each word's state (visible, hidden, or blacked out) determines its visual presentation (white text, gray text, or black rectangle). Mouse position is tracked for clicking words to toggle their blackout state, while keyboard controls ('Space' to reveal hidden text, 'B' to restore previous blackouts, 'R' to reset) allow users to easily change and manipulate the poem to their liking. Users can mess around with the piece and create their own poems, some which may be hard to make sense of and work with. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked alone. The creation of this piece went pretty smoothly for the main technical parts of it. I took some time to really come up with a plan of what I wanted to do for this experiment. I knew immediately I wanted to work with blackout poetry, but that didn’t feel like enough for me and I wanted to add in an additional element and a form of surprise or randomness. That is when I thought of having a hidden poem that can be revealed and fill in the words that were blacked out by the user previously. Then users would be able to continue the blackout process and create another piece as well. 
					I think the lows of the project was figuring out how to customize the text. I had some trouble getting the hidden text to be a different color so that it would be apparent what words were previously blacked out and how they are now words from the hidden layer of the poem. I worked with this part for quite a bit of time until I was finally able to figure it out.  
					I had some good highs for the project. I was able to get the functionality working pretty quickly. I had some great starter code I could integrate into my piece with the help of ChatGPT. This definitely gave me a confidence boost and helped me move forward with the piece without getting discouraged. I think a high was also being able to add in different key inputs to allow users to customize their experience a little bit and be able to generate new combinations of poems or toggle between the blackout poem or the mixed line poem. 	
				Overall, I am super happy with the end outcome of this project. I like how the piece allows for user creativity and adds an element of surprise and randomness. I also like how the users are playing around with lines that I wrote myself, which definitely adds that bit of personal touch. </p>
