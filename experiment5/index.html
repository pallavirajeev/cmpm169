				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A three-dimensional aquatic scene created with inspiration from the countless jellyfish tanks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The jellyfish are drawn into the scene at random positions each time the piece is refreshed. Each jellyfish gently dances around in the tank with movement generated using sine and cosine functions for smooth floating with swaying tentacles influenced by perlin noise. Users can explore the scene from different angles and zoom using their mouse, with every element of the environment— from the tank and water to the jellyfish—crafted using 3D graphics. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This scene is created using both p5.js and WEBGL, where a 3D canvas renders the jellyfish tank. Multiple jellyfish objects are then instantiated into the tank, each with random initial positions. Each jellyfish's floating movement is controlled using sine and cosine functions to create smooth up/down and lateral drifts. The jellyfish tentacles are drawn using Bezier curves, and sway with the influence of Perlin noise. This is what gives them that organic look of random movement. The tank and water are represented with basic 3D shapes (boxes), and the user can rotate the scene using mouse controls. The environment, jellyfish, and water are all generated and animated in 3D space.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked alone. Overall I was pretty pleased with the process of actually creating the piece. However, I was initially very intimidated by the idea of working with 3D graphics. I had no clue how to go about this and what idea to implement. Even looking at the constraints didn’t help me choose an idea. I finally went onto my camera roll for some inspiration. That is when I was reminded of my recent trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I saw some beautiful jellyfish in their tank and that was definitely my favorite sighting from that trip. I knew then that that is what I wanted to do with my piece. I wanted to replicate a jellyfish tank with the help of 3D graphics. 
					I would say coming up with the idea of the main “low” of the project. I normally am instantly inspired when I see the prompt of the experiment but this time I really lacked ideas. I felt defeated before even starting the project. As explained above, I really was not sure what to do with this experiment and where to go with things. 
					After getting past this initial block, I had some good highs for the project. I really enjoyed being able to find good documentation directly from p5.js for the elements I wanted to integrate into my code. That made the integration process go smoothly for me because I appreciate how clear the documentation can be. I was also super pleased with how my piece was starting to look piece by piece. I was definitely intimidated by the idea of 3D objects and creating them with code initially, but putting the pieces together I felt much more confident. 
					Overall, I am super happy with the end outcome of this project. I like how the piece does reflect a real jellyfish tank and that users can actually tell what I created. I also like how the jellyfish movement turned out as I think it is very satisfying to watch.
