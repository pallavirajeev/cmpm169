				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A playful creation with the layering of images to create an illustration of moon phases changing throughout a changing sky. A moon ‘orbits’ around the sky while the sky in the background changes colors to represent the passing of time. Users can customize their experience by pressing ‘H’ to visualize the change of the sky based on hours or ‘S’ to view a shorter simulation if they don’t have hours to wait. Users can also adjust the speed of the orbiting moon by pressing ‘1’ to increase speed and ‘2’ to decrease the speed. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This experiment simulates the changing moon phases of an orbiting moon through a changing sky with visuals that represent the passage of time. The moon follows a circular path calculated with trigonometric functions, while the background smoothly transitions colors based on the actual time of day; specifically the current hour or the seconds, depending on user input. The simulation continuously updates each and updates the sky’s color based on time, calculates the moon’s position, and renders the images to create both an interactive and immersive experience.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked alone. The process went pretty smoothly overall, though there were some bumps in the ride especially when finding code starting pieces. I used the structured approach and attempted to create my take on a time-lapse evolution. When seeing this idea, I knew I wanted to play around with the idea of moon phases. I love the moon and the different phases and I thought it would be good to use that as inspiration for my idea. I wanted to use different images to make the piece come to life how I imagined. 
					The lows of the project was finding a good starting point. Although I had a vision in my mind, it was hard to find a good starting point for my “imitate” portion of my creation. I spent a great deal of time looking through code and art examples before finally starting with something very basic and then building up. Because of this hassle, I did feel defeated and almost wanted to switch my idea to something different. But instead I pursued the original idea I had, as it really felt like me and fit my likings. 
				The highs of this project was getting inspiration for the additional changes I wanted to make each time I modified my piece. I felt that once I got started and past my initial block, I had a much faster flow of thought and creativity. I was happy with my ideas and had a fun time implementing and innovating my piece with my new ideas. I was also super excited about adding in a component relevant to the actual time of day because I love the concept of art connecting with something and changing based on the actual time. 
					Overall, I am super happy with the end outcome of this project. I like how the users have a bit of customization when it comes to their experience with the piece. I also especially love the aspect of tying in time with the art piece and using it as a component.
