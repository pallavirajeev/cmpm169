				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, inspired by the fires that broke out in my hometown during the creation of the piece, I am trying to accomplish a full circle fire simulation. In order to achieve this, I incorporating "burning" cells that use user input to start a fire. A fire can be started based on user mouse input and is partnered with red flames, grey smokey particles, and a crackling sound effect. Users can press "w" to water down the fires they created, listen to the fire extinguish, and reset all the burns, allowing the process to come full circle and be repeated again and again.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This piece is based on Jeff Thompson’s simple p5.js fire simulation. It uses Thompson’s piece as a starting point and builds off to allow users to ignite fires with mouse clicks and then extinguish them using the “w” key. Trees burn and spread the fire to adjacent cells, while smoke particles and fire sounds add realism. Smoke particles also fade over time, creating an immersive visual effect. The burned areas may show glowing red patches to replicate the look of a flame, and pressing “w” transforms burned cells into water to replicate extinguishing, before resetting the forest and coming full circle. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I worked alone. The entire process went smoother than my first experiment, as I now have some more experience working with p5.js. I used the structured approach to inspire and direct my ideas towards a project. I immediately knew I wanted to do the fire simulation, because of all the talk of the fires breaking out in my hometown of San Diego. I looked on the internet for inspiration for a starting point and found Jeff Thompson’s simple fire simulation which just “burned” -changed the color of- adjacent cells starting at the middle cell on the canvas. I knew I could take this and turn it into a creative piece to my liking. I looked up some images of burning fires from my hometown, and used those images as inspiration. 
					The lows of the project was learning how to incorporate audio into p5.js. When first looking into examples of how to add audio, I only looked at p5.js examples. The code was not too complicated, but I did not understand where to add my audio files. I was having some trouble navigating the p5.js environment, since it is still a little new to me. I finally found a super helpful video and realized that adding audio wasn’t too complicated. However, this was definitely a low for me as I was getting frustrated with not being able to get the audio to work as quickly as I hoped. I also had some slight trouble getting my audio code changed to work in VS Code, since the code is slightly different and I needed to upload the audio files to the VS Code project. 
				The highs of this project was figuring out the different components that I wanted to add to this piece and seeing my creativity in action. Each time I added something like the fire, or the smoke, I felt inspired by a new idea or a new change. This is how I came up with the water idea and having it look like the fire was being extinguished. I was super proud of this idea and it really made the whole “full circle” aspect of the project come to life. 
					Overall, I am super happy with the end outcome of this project. I like how my code really exhibits that “full circle” aspect and can essentially be replayable as many times as the user wants. I also like how the piece uses user input and the users can start the fires where they please and watch them grow. They can also extinguish the fires at any point, which gives the pieces that slight customizable touch.
