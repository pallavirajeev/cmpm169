                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>An interactive mood analysis that lets users input their mood and get a colored representation of their mood. The mood is analyzed in real time using the pre-trained ml5.js sentiment model. The mood input is visually represented through an evolving color, making it both informative and engaging for the user.

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>The project uses p5.js and machine learning to analyze user-inputted mood descriptions. The sentiment is processed using ml5.js for real-time analysis, and the result is displayed along with a color-coded feedback system. The sentiment analysis is processed in real-time when the user clicks the submit button. The sentiment level is then displayed as a numerical value and color-coded based on the detected emotional tone. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>For this experiment, I worked alone. The creation of this piece went pretty smoothly except there was quite a bit of a learning curve. I have never used machine learning with my experiments or before for anything else so I had a slow start with figuring out how to navigate ml5.js. However, the ideation process was pretty quick for me because I knew what I wanted to try and recreate some sort of mood generator that had colors based on the mood of the user. 
					The lows of the project would be integrating my code into my portfolio. I spent so much time working with the code to get it to display sort of like how it displays on my p5.js editor. I had some trouble because the styling was connected to the rest of the elements on the website and I needed to rearrange some things to only stylize the mood part of the code with the pink styling I used on p5.js. 
					For the project highs, I would say getting the example code integrated with my code and to do what I was hoping to do. I had really low expectations for this experiment because I have never worked with machine learning concepts and this was all new to me. I was scared to mess up or not be able to get my code working. Therefore, seeing my code work was a great high for the experiment. 	
				Overall, I am happy with the end outcome of this project. I like that I was able to integrate the sentiment model and turn it into a color generator based on moods, when it was originally used to determine if movie reviews were positive or negative.
